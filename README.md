## ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at **Cornell University** studying **natural neuroscience** in rodent models through ***outdoor fieldwork***.

### ðŸ§  Research Focus

I investigate how neural circuits encode **territorial behavior** using _large scale extracellular electrophysiology_ and **natural neuroscience approaches** in ***wild settings***.

**Neuroethological Studies in Naturalistic Settings**
- Multi-electrode recordings in **house mice** in _outdoor paddock environments_
- Neural dynamics during **social encounters** and ***spatial boundary establishment*** in the field
