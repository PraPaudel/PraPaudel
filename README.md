## ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at Cornell University studying how mice brains work during territorial behavior in the wild.

### ðŸ§  Research Focus

I investigate how neural circuits encode territorial behaviors in mice using field-based electrophysiology.

**Neural Mechanisms of Territorial Behavior in Field Settings**
- Multi-electrode recordings from mice
- Neural dynamics during territorial encounters and boundary establishment
